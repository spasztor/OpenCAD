# OpenCAD

## Project Description
**OpenCAD** is an open source CAD software prototype. The vision is to be an open source CAD software designed for general all purpose compuiter aided drafting along with providing powerful tools for engineers and alike. OpenCAD's philosophy is to reduce mundane tasks with pumping out a massive planset and instead let the drafter do simple drafting once again.

### Project Owner(s)
* Szabolcs Pasztor

### Target Audience
* Szabolcs Pasztor
* Any current CAD user such as:
    * AutoCAD users
    * BricsCAD Users
* Any potentential CAD users such as:
    * Civil Engineers
    * Architects
    * Landscapers
    * Old timers who currently draft by hand.

### Method of Communication
Github Issues
### Goals
* Provide a command console for interacting with the program
* Provide File Management (I.E. File open, close, read and write). Files will be in [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/json/) format for now.
* Allow operations or commands to be performed that manipulate the data. The commands along with their description can be found below.
* With the commands, create, edit and delete basic CAD typical objects. Specifically this will include:

| Object Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Point       | An object with an X value, Y value, Elevation and Handle. |
| test | test|

 Points with an X, Y, Elevation and Handle Polyline
 
* Allow for one to enter bad input that doesn't mean anything.
* Allow for one to undo whatever a command did.
* Allow for one to cancel the current active command which would interrupt the current command, stop it and undo any work it did.
